How's it going? Long time no speak.

I thought it was about time I carved out a little cave of my own in the
internet. Just so that I can daub some half-baked thoughts on the wall for
posterity more than anything else.

I find when I'm working on some project or another that it's not until I take a
step back to try and write up some documentation, or explain it to a normal
person, that I'm able to see the wood for the trees. Hopefully by marshalling
some ideas in this new "digital text" format I can structure my endeavours a bit
better.

We shall see.
